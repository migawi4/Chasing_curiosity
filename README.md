# Chasing_curiosity
My first public adventure into computer programming. Computers are cool and I should probably learn how to use them. 

Curiosity is a funny thing. I began my career in enterprise sales at Okta. Following Okta I joined Common Room, a developer marketing platform. Throughout the last 2 years I've spent time helping OSS companies think through their GTM strategy. My collective experiences throughout the first 7 years of my career have influenced me to want to dive deeper into the world of computing.

I am brand new to programming and I am motivated to learn how the future of the world will be created. The ongoing series of events that follow this post(?) are unknown. I expect to go down many rabbit holes and hopefully learn a few things about programming, AI/ML, and other concepts that I may not have been exposed to yet at the time of me writing this. 

Anyways, here goes nothin'.
