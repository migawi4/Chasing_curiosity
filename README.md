# Chasing_curiosity
My first public adventure into computer programming. Computers are cool and I should probably learn how to use them. 

Curiosity is a funny thing. Throughout the last 2 years I've spent time helping OSS companies think through their GTM strategy. During that period I've been fortunate to spend time with brilliant people from companies like Supabase, Apollo GraphQL, Timescale, Aiven, etc.

I am brand new to programming and I am motivated to learn how the future of the world will be created. The ongoing series of events that follow this post(?) are unknown. I expect to go down many rabbit holes and hopefully learn a few things about programming, AI/ML, and other concepts that I may not have been exposed to yet at the time of me writing this. 

Anyways, here goes nothin'.
